    <title>The extended TabbedPane component for VLDocking.</title>

  <body>
<p> This package contains classes allowing to embed buttons into the tabs of a jtabbedpane.

<p> Although it supports any number of tabs, the current implementation for the docking framework 
 only uses one : a close rollover button located on the right of the tab's label.
